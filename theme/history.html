            <h3>Early History</h3>
            <p>The first group to settle on the Iberian peninsula were the Phoenicians,
                 who arrived around the year 1100 BCE. Soon after, the Celtics arrived and
                  settled the north. By the year 19 BCE, all of Spain and the Iberian Peninsula
                   fell under the control of the Romans.</p>

            <h3>The Moors and the Reconquista</h3>
            <p>In the year 711 CE, the Moors invaded Spain from North Africa and renamed
                 the kingdom "al-Andalus". The influence of their rule over the south of 
                 Spain is still very prominent. One of the most notable impacts is architecture, 
                 as Islam-influenced designs are seen on buildings throughout the south. In the year
                 718, the Christians began their efforts to retake Spain, known as the "Reconquista".</p>

            <h3>The Spanish Inquisition</h3>
            <p>The Spanish Inquisition was formed in the year 1480. Its main purpose was 
                to enforce Roman Catholicism, and it was responsible for jailing, sentencing, 
                and torturing people who had not completely converted. It was created by the 
                monarchs Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand. It remained active through the year 
                1820.

            <h3>Francisco Franco</h3>
            <p>Francisco Franco was the dictator of Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975. 
                Although the declared Spain to be neutral during World War II, he provided a 
                lot of military help to the Axis powers. His regime led to the death of as many as 
                400,000 of his opponents. Before he died, he restored the Spanish monarchy, which made 
                King Juan Carlos I his succesor. He led Spain through the transition to democracy after 
                Franco's death.
