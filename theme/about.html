        <p>My name's Betsy and I'm a Running Start student at Bellevue College. This is 
            my second year at BC since I'm currently a high school senior. After I 
            graduate, I plan on studying international business in college.
        </p>

        <p>Before this 
            quarter, I had never coded and knew nothing about programming. So far, I feel 
            like I've learned a lot and I think it's really cool to see the progress I've 
            made so far.
        </p>

        <p>Right now, I work as a barista at Starbucks and a marketing intern for 
            an insurance agency. In my free time I like to spend time with friends, learn 
            foreign languages, take my dog for walks, and read.
        </p>

        <p>My biggest passion is definitely traveling. Whenever I have the chance, I love 
            going and seeing new places. One of my most recent trips was to Granada, Spain. 
            Last summer, I spent two weeks there with a host family and it was one of the 
            most amazing experiences of my life. I learned so much and met so many amazing 
            people, I hope to be able to do similar trips in the future. This trip actually 
            inspired my theme for this website!
