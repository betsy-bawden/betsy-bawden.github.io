        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>The Alhambra is a palace located in Granada, Spain. It was originally 
            constructed as a small fortress around the year AD 889, but it was renovated 
            and rebuilt in the mid-13th century. While the palace has spent centuries 
            being controlled by both Christian and Muslim rulers, many of the design 
            influences (such as the intricate shapes that decorate the palace) are 
            representative of Islam.</p>

        <h2>Generalife</h2>
        <p>One of the buildings that surrounds the palace is known as Generalife. 
            When the area was ruled by the Nasrids, Generalife served as their summer palace. 
            Thus, it is very green and has large gardens and fountains.</p>
