            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>The Sagrada Familia is one of the most well-known landmarks in Spain. 
                It is located in the city of Barcelona. It is a Roman Catholic Church 
                designed by the famous Catalan architect, Antoni Gaudi. What makes it very 
                notable is that while construction started in 1882, it has yet to be 
                completed.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Contruction for the Sagrada Familia started in 1882, under the architect 
                Francisco de Paula del Villar. When he resigned, Antoni Gaudi took over. 
                Gaudi's transformation of the original design was significant because he 
                combined both gothic and art noveau designs. He worked on the project 
                for the remainder of his life, until he died in an accident at the age of 
                73. He was so devoted to the project that his body is actually buried in 
                the crypts. At the time of his death, the project was less than a quarter 
                of the way complete.

            <h3>Present Day</h3>
            <p>Contruction continues to this day and reached the halfway mark in 2010. 
                It is anticipated that contruction will be finished by 2026, the 100 year 
                anniversary of Gaudi's death. Modern day technologies have helped speed up 
                the process, although many of the most challenging parts of the design 
                have yet to be started. The monument was declared a UNESCO World Heritage 
                Site, and in 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated it and proclaimed it a 
                minor basilica.
            </p>

            <h4>Controversy</h4>
            <p>The monument has been a topic of debate among much of the population of 
                Barcelona. Some of the biggest concerns have been:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>If it will compete with Barcelona's main Cathedral</li>
                <li>That the work after Gaudi's death did not stick to his design</li>
                <li>The construction of an underground train that connects Spain and 
                    France, that could potentially disturb the stability</li>
            </ul>
