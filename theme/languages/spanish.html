            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>The official language of Spain is Spanish. It is the most spoken language, and 
                is spoken by almost 99% of the population as a first or second language. The 
                variety of Spanish spoken in Spain is known as Castilian or European Spanish. 
                However, there are many variants of the language and certain features vary from 
                region to region.</p>

            <aside>
                <p>Some regional dialects of Spanish are:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>Andalusian Spanish</li>
                        <li>Canarian Spanish</li>
                        <li>Castrapo (spoken in Galicia)</li>
                        <li>Murcian Spanish</li>
                    </ul>
            </aside>

            <p>While there are several varieties and accents, they are mutually intelligible 
                and can be understood all across the country.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Around 2000 BC, the inhabitants of the Iberian peninsula spoke celtic 
                languages. However, they began learning Latin from the Romans. The 
                combination of celtic languages and Latin resulted in what is now known 
                as Vulgar Latin.
                <br>
                <br>
                Latin remained the predominant language of the region for many years 
                until the arrival of the Moors. It can now be estimated that roughly 
                3000-4000 words in Spanish have Arabic origins/roots.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Castilian dialect of Spanish began to dominate the region around the 
                13th century, thanks to King Alfonso X. The influence of Castilian 
                Spanish continued to grow as Catholic Kingdoms took over the peninsula, 
                and once Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand declared it the official 
                language of the kingdom.
