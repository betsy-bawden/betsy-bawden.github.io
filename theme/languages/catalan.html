            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Catalan is the second most spoken language in Spain (after Spanish). 
                It is spoken by roughly 17% of the population as either a first or second 
                language. The majority of speakers live in the region of Catalonia, 
                although it is also spoken in other regions such as Valencia.</p>

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>The Catalan language evolved from Vulgar Latin during the middle ages. 
                It was spoken throughout the western half of Spain, as well as in parts of 
                Italy and France. However, as Spanish became more standardized around the 
                15th century, the use of Catalan began to decrease.
                <br>
                <br>
                In 1789, shortly after the French Revolution, the use of Catalan was 
                prohibited in the south of France, where there was a significant 
                number of speakers.
                <br>
                <br>
                The use of the language continued to decline in Spain and the surrounding 
                countries until the 19th century, when Catalan saw a literary revival. 
                However, the Franco dictatorship banned the use of Catalan in schools 
                and public administration between 1939 and 1975.

            <h3>Present Day</h3>
            <p>Since the Spanish transition towards democracy, Catalan has 
                regained its official status. The majority of the population of 
                Catalonia is bilingual. Approximately 9 million people around the world
                can speak it, while 11 million can understand it. The majority of the 
                speakers live in Spain, although there are minority groups in both Italy 
                and France that have a significant number of speakers. Additionally, 
                Catalan is the official language of Andorra, a small country between 
                Spain and France where there are around 70,000 speakers. </p>

            <p>Within Spain, the language currently has official status in Catalonia, 
                Valencia, the Balearic Islands, and La Franja (a small community in Aragonia).</p>
